# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Biztrack

## 1. Overview & Objectives

### 1.1 Purpose of the Application
Biztrack is a comprehensive business management dashboard designed for independent business owners, supervisors, and network marketers. It serves as a central hub for managing client relationships (CRM), tracking daily tasks, visualizing organizational structures, and scheduling follow-ups.

### 1.2 Core Problems It Solves
-   **Fragmented Data:** Consolidates client lists, task managers, and calendars into one app.
-   **Follow-Up Management:** Prevents lost leads by tracking "Next Follow-Up" dates and highlighting overdue calls.
-   **Team Visualization:** Replaces manual drawing or spreadsheets with a dynamic, zoomable Organization Tree.
-   **Productivity Tracking:** Provides clear metrics on daily calls due, tasks pending, and overall database growth.

### 1.3 Target Users & Use Cases
-   **Business Owner / Supervisor:**
    -   Managing a personal database of clients (users, prospects, associates).
    -   Tracking personal daily tasks and appointments.
    -   Visualizing and editing their downline/team structure.
    -   Monitoring business growth metrics.

## 2. User Personas & Roles

### 2.1 User Types
The application currently supports a single primary user type with authenticated access.

*   **Registered User (Owner):** Has full read/write access to their own isolated data (Clients, Tasks, Org Tree, Profile).

### 2.2 Permissions & Access Control
-   **Authentication:** Required for all features. Handled via Firebase Auth.
-   **Data Isolation:**
    -   All data (Clients, Tasks, Org Nodes) is scoped to the `currentUser.uid` in Firestore.
    -   Users cannot access or modify another user's data.
-   **Role-Based Features:**
    -   Currently, all registered users have the same feature set.
    -   The "Business Tier" (Supervisor, World Team, President Team, etc.) is a profile attribute that may influence future features but currently serves as metadata.

## 4. User Flows & Workflows

### 4.1 Daily Workflow (Morning Routine)
1.  **Login:** User logs in.
2.  **Dashboard Check:** User sees "Calls Due" count = 5.
3.  **Outreach:**
    *   User clicks "Call" on first client in Outreach List.
    *   User performs call (external).
    *   User returns, clicks checkmark.
    *   **Call Outcome Modal** appears.
    *   User selects outcome (e.g., "Spoke to client"), sets next follow-up date.
    *   Client is removed from "Due" list.
4.  **Task Execution:**
    *   User checks Priority Task List.
    *   Completes high-priority items.
    *   Marks them as "Completed".
5.  **Review Calendar:** Checks upcoming schedule for the week.

### 4.2 Data Import Flow
1.  Navigate to **Clients** page.
2.  Click **Import Clients**.
3.  Upload `.xlsx` file.
4.  **Preview Modal** opens, showing successfully parsed rows and errors.
5.  User reviews data.
6.  Click **Import**.
7.  Batch write to Firestore occurs. List refreshes.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Business Logic
-   **Overdue Logic:** A task/call is overdue if `date < today (00:00:00)`.
-   **Org Tree:** A node cannot be its own parent. Deleting a node must delete the entire subtree to prevent orphaned nodes.
-   **Data Sync:** Updates in one session (e.g., phone) must reflect immediately in others (e.g., laptop) using Firestore listeners.

### 5.2 Data Handling
-   **Persistence:** LocalStorage used for unsaved UI states (if any); core data persists in Firestore.
-   **Offline:** App should load with cached Firestore data if offline (if enabled in Firebase config), otherwise requires connection.
-   **Validation:**
    -   Mobile numbers must be valid format (managed by `react-phone-number-input`).
    -   Required fields (Name, Mobile) must be present.

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance
-   **Load Time:** Dashboard should render priority content (metrics) within 1.5s.
-   **List Virtualization:** (Recommended) Client lists should handle 1000+ records without scroll lag. *Current implementation uses pagination (50 items) to mitigate this.*
-   **Bulk Operations:** Bulk delete of 500 items should complete within 5s (batched).

### 6.2 Security
-   **Rules:** Firestore Security Rules must strictly enforce `request.auth.uid == userId` for all paths.
-   **Inputs:** All inputs sanitized (React default).
-   **Secrets:** API keys (Firebase config) are public-safe; sensitive logic (if any) should be in Cloud Functions (none currently).

### 6.3 Reliability
-   **Error Handling:** Failed network requests should trigger user-friendly alerts/toasts (e.g., "Failed to save").
-   **Conflict Resolution:** Last-write-wins strategy for concurrent edits on same document.

---

## 7. UI / UX Requirements

### 7.1 Visual Design
-   **Framework:** Tailwind CSS.
-   **Theme:** Clean, modern SaaS aesthetic. White/Slate background, Blue primary actions.
-   **Responsiveness:**
    -   **Mobile:** Stacked layouts, bottom sheets (month selector), hamburger menus (if applicable).
    -   **Desktop:** Sidebar navigation (implied layout), Grid layouts (3-col dashboard), Modal centers.

### 7.2 Accessibility
-   **ARIA:** Buttons and Inputs should have labels.
-   **Focus:** Modals should trap focus.
-   **Contrast:** Text should meet WCAG AA standards (Slate-500/Slate-900 usually sufficient).

---

## 8. Data Model & Integrations

### 8.1 Data Entities (Firestore)
*   **User (`users/{uid}`)**: `name`, `email`, `level`, `phoneNumber`, `photoURL`, `avatarColor`.
*   **Task (`users/{uid}/tasks/{taskId}`)**: `title`, `priority`, `status`, `dueDate`, `notes`.
*   **Client (`users/{uid}/clients/{clientId}`)**: `clientName`, `mobile`, `clientType`, `status`, `nextFollowUpDate`, `notes`, `frequency`.
*   **OrgNode (`users/{uid}/orgNodes/{nodeId}`)**: `name`, `role`, `level`, `parentId`. Note: `children` computed client-side.

### 8.2 Integrations
-   **Firebase Authentication:** Identity management.
-   **Firebase Firestore:** NoSQL Database.
-   **WhatsApp:** "Click to Chat" integration using `wa.me` links for client mobile numbers.

---

## 9. Assumptions & Constraints
-   **Internet Required:** Primary functionality relies on connection to Firebase.
-   **Single Tenant per Account:** No "Team" sharing feature; "Team" page is for visualization of downline, not shared access.
-   **Max Children Depth:** Tree visualization assumes reasonable depth/breadth; extreme nesting may degrade UI performance.
-   **Mobile Parsing:** Excel import assumes standard mobile formats; extremely malformed numbers may need manual correction.

## 10. Acceptance Criteria

### 10.1 Core Functionality
-   [ ] User can sign up, log in, and log out successfully.
-   [ ] Creating a client appears immediately in "All Clients".
-   [ ] Creating a task with "High" priority appears in "Priority Tasks".
-   [ ] Deleting a client removes them from all lists.

### 10.2 Workflow Validation
-   [ ] "Marking Done" a call from Dashboard moves it out of "Calls Due".
-   [ ] Importing an Excel file with 50 valid rows results in 50 new client records.
-   [ ] Adding a child node in Team view correctly links it to the parent in the tree structure.
