  "product_overview": "Biztrack is a comprehensive business management dashboard designed for independent business owners and supervisors to manage client relationships, tasks, team structure, and scheduling all within one centralized application.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Consolidate client management, task tracking, calendar scheduling, and team visualization in a single platform.",
    "Prevent lost leads by tracking follow-ups and highlighting calls/tasks that are due or overdue.",
    "Provide dynamic visualization of organizational structure to replace manual methods.",
    "Enable users to monitor and improve productivity through clear daily metrics and activity tracking.",
    "Ensure data isolation and security so each user accesses and modifies only their own data.",
    "Support data import/export to facilitate onboarding and reporting.",
    "Provide seamless authentication and role-based access control to protect user data."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Authentication system supporting Email/Password and Google Sign-In with secure session management, password reset, and account deletion.",
    "Dashboard with real-time metrics including calls due, task statistics, active client counts, prioritized outreach and tasks, quick actions, and recent activity feed.",
    "Comprehensive Client Management CRM that supports client addition/editing, call outcome logging, filtering/sorting, bulk actions, archiving, import/export capabilities.",
    "Task Manager with prioritized tasks, filters, progress visualization, and full CRUD operations.",
    "Interactive Calendar with month and day views displaying scheduled calls and tasks, supporting rescheduling and status toggling.",
    "Team management via an interactive, zoomable Organization Tree visualizing hierarchy with node addition, editing, and recursive deletion.",
    "User Profile management including editable personal details, avatar uploads, report settings, and security functions like password changes and activity viewing.",
    "Robust data management backed by Firebase Firestore with real-time synchronization, offline caching, and validation for inputs.",
    "Integration with WhatsApp for client communication via click-to-chat links."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "Daily Morning Workflow: User logs in, reviews dashboard metrics and outreach list, completes calls and tasks, updates call outcomes, and checks calendar for upcoming events.",
    "Data Import Flow: User navigates to Clients, uploads an Excel file for client data, previews parsed data with error handling, and confirms import to update their CRM.",
    "Team Management Flow: User views the Organization Tree, adds or edits team nodes including roles and business levels, and deletes nodes along with their descendants when required.",
    "Client Management: Users add, edit, archive, delete clients, log call outcomes, search/filter clients, and perform bulk operations.",
    "Task Management: Users create tasks, update status, prioritize, and monitor task completion progress visually."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "Users can successfully sign up, log in, log out, and access their data securely.",
    "New clients appear immediately in the client list upon creation; similarly, deleting clients removes them from all relevant views.",
    "Marking a call done from the dashboard updates the client's follow-up status and removes them from the Calls Due list.",
    "Importing client data from Excel files correctly creates the appropriate number of client records without data loss or errors.",
    "Adding child nodes in the Organization Tree correctly reflects hierarchical relationships and updates in realtime.",
    "Dashboard loads primary content metrics within 1.5 seconds under normal network conditions.",
    "Bulk delete operations of large datasets complete within acceptable performance thresholds (e.g., 500 items in under 5 seconds).",
    "Application enforces strict Firestore security rules limiting data access to authenticated users' own data.",
    "Input fields enforce validation rules such as required fields and valid phone number formats.",
    "Offline usage works with cached data where connectivity is unavailable, maintaining data integrity on reconnection."
